Introduction to website

This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to represent the Full Stack Development Club (FSDC) — a student-led initiative dedicated to tech learning and collaboration.
I designed and developed this site from scratch. It serves as the club’s official digital presence, helping students discover events, explore learning resources, and connect with our vibrant developer community.

What is FSDC?
The Full Stack Development Club is a student-driven initiative aimed at helping learners grow their skills in full-stack web and app development. Whether you're a beginner or experienced coder, this club provides opportunities to learn and collaborate through real-world projects and workshops.

Website Overview
The FSDC site introduces the club’s mission, structure, and activities. It's built to inform potential members and showcase ongoing efforts, highlighting the club's dynamic, tech-forward culture.

Events and Workshops
The site lists hands-on training events covering modern development tools and frameworks like Flutter, Spring Boot, and more. These sessions are great for leveling up skills in both front-end and back-end development.
